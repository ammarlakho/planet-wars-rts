# 🪐 PlanetWars AI Competition – Submission Instructions

Welcome to the PlanetWars AI competition! This document describes how to package and submit your entry. Your agent should run as a WebSocket server and respond to JSON-formatted messages. Each submission must include a `Dockerfile` that builds and runs your agent.

We support entries in **Kotlin/Java** or **Python**. Please follow the instructions below depending on your chosen language.

---

## 📦 Submission Format

Each submission must:

1. Contain all necessary code and dependencies to build and run your agent.
2. Include a working `Dockerfile` that listens on **port 8080** and runs your agent server.
3. Be able to receive JSON game states and return legal actions via **WebSocket on port 8080**.
4. Be self-contained (no internet access during runtime).

---

## ☕ Kotlin/Java Submission

Your Kotlin or Java project must produce a single `.jar` file that runs the WebSocket server.

### Example `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Use Java 20
FROM eclipse-temurin:20-jdk

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the compiled jar (ensure this path matches your Gradle build output)
COPY app/build/libs/client-server.jar app.jar

# Expose WebSocket port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the agent
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]

```
Around line 81, ensure this points to the main file you want to run your agent server from:
```kotlin
application {
    mainClass.set("competition_entry.RunEntryAsServerKt") // Adjust to match your actual package and file
}
```
In the example code, this loads in the Careful Random Agent:
```kotlin
package competition_entry

import games.planetwars.agents.random.CarefulRandomAgent
import json_rmi.GameAgentServer

fun main() {
    val server = GameAgentServer(port = 8080, agentClass = CarefulRandomAgent::class)
    server.start(wait = true)
}

```
